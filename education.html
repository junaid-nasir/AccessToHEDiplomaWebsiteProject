     <!-- Info
     	This website has been created having done research online, whereby I was able to find tools and resources to help create the website. It includes styles such as fonts that were outsourced, with the link available in the CSS page. Other CSS pages such as animate.css, boostrap.css, bootstrap.min.css, owl.carousel.css, owl.theme and responsive.css have elements that were outsourced with references to their original authors indicated within the pages to avoid copyright. Most of which are open source projects. Github is a key resource used and seen throughout the website. The style.css page is the primary styling element used within this, which also includes many of my adjustments to produce a site that has matching styling to meet the house style and design requirements I had set in order to be a personal portfolio.

    <!-- Navigation
    ==========================================-->
    <!-- Here I have set the headings to include labels that navigates the user to different section of the website. It scrolls down rather than opening a new page, since I wanted all of the content to be displayed on a single page. This assists with the design I wanted to set and helps to organise the content better. The labels have the 'page-scroll' class attached to ensure they all have the same formatting to ensure they match the house style. Additionally, this is set to collapse so that more screen real-estate can be used to display more of the selected section. It will only collapse a small amount so that the buttons are still available for the user to select.-->

    <!-- Home Page
    ==========================================-->
    <!-- This is the home page for my website. The site has been created so that all of the information will be displayed on one page rather than having multiple page for each section. This enabled me to have a flow throughout the website as the page slides from one section to the next. I used the 'tf-home' and 'overlay' class to set the brackground, add filter and set the height. The 'content' class sets the position and padding. Since the site contains significant information on Sirenum, I noted this within the Title of the site seen as 'Sirenum Edition'. The 'strong' element has been used to make the specific text bold, enabling it to stand out. -->
